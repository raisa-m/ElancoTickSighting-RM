# Elanco Tick Sighting Project - Raisa Mumin
My project is a visual representation of tick sightings. It provides an interactive map that lets users view, filter and report tick sightings across the United Kingdom. This project is built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no backend. Everything is able to run within the browser.

The primary goal for this project is to make it easier for users to understand where ticks are being found, what species they may be as well as tips to help prevent ticks.
